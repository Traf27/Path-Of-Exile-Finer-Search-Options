# Path-Of-Exile-Finer-Search-Options - [Install link](https://github.com/maxbourdarie/Path-Of-Exile-Finer-Search-Options/raw/master/poe-finer-search-options.user.js)

Poe Finer Search Options is a userScript enhancing the official Path of exile [trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade) website by offering the possibility to filter in/out any item mod directly from a search result list

It extends what the "Filter by item stats" button does but allows finer control over what it offers

* easily see what mods are already present in your "and" filter groups (highlighted in green)

* access two new buttons "+" and "-" by hovering over any mod in the list
  * clicking "+" adds the mod to the first (non default) "and" filter group in your search. If none exists, it creates it
  * clicking "-" adds the mod to the first "not" filter group in your search. If none exists, it creates it
